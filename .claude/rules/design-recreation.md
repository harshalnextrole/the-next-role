# Website Design Recreation

## Workflow

When the user provides a reference image (screenshot) and optionally some CSS classes or style notes:

1. **Generate** the component or page using Tailwind CSS within the existing Next.js/React structure. Match the reference as closely as possible.
2. **Screenshot** the rendered page using Puppeteer (`npx puppeteer screenshot index.html --fullpage` or equivalent). If the page has distinct sections, capture those individually too.
3. **Compare** your screenshot against the reference image. Check for mismatches in:
   - Spacing and padding (measure in px)
   - Font sizes, weights, and line heights
   - Colors (exact hex values)
   - Alignment and positioning
   - Border radii, shadows, and effects
   - Responsive behavior
   - Image/icon sizing and placement
4. **Fix** every mismatch found. Edit the HTML/Tailwind code.
5. **Re-screenshot** and compare again.
6. **Repeat** steps 3-5 until the result is within ~2-3px of the reference everywhere.

Do NOT stop after one pass. Always do at least 2 comparison rounds. Only stop when the user says so or when no visible differences remain.

## Technical Defaults

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes (project already has Tailwind configured — do NOT use CDN)
- Use placeholder images from `https://placehold.co/` when source images aren't provided
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Match the project's existing design system colors and typography when recreating pages for this site
